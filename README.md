## 🚀 About Me

I’m a student at **Sharjah Indian School**, and I spend my free time exploring the fascinating world of **web development**. My journey into coding started with a simple curiosity about creative website designs. I stumbled upon TikTok videos showcasing UI design, and that sparked my interest. Fast forward to now, and I’m diving deep into creating aesthetic designs for websites, constantly learning new techniques to make them visually stunning.
One of my biggest inspirations is the UI design of the Nothing phone—its clean, minimalist look really fuels my passion for UI/UX.

I believe in creating websites that aren’t just functional but enjoyable to interact with. I love bringing ideas to life, whether it’s a smooth user experience or a visually appealing layout. My goal? To create web experiences that are both beautiful and easy to use. 🌐💻
